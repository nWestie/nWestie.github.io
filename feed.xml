They didn’t even spin! Ever since, I’ve had the idea in the back of my head to design a clock where all the functional gears are clearly visible.</p> <p>It was during my final project for a CAD course that I decided to actually have a go at it, and came up with a design based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycloidal_drive">cycloidal drives</a>. Specifically, I was inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xoCeliJ11Q">Levi Janssen’s</a> video showing a design for a single-plane, multistage cycloidal gearbox, and based my design for a clock of this style of gearbox. Cycloidal gearboxes are typically structured simiarly to a planetary reducer, but this concept rearranges the cycloidal drive so the output is the output is the ring gear, not the carrier. This allows multiple reducers to be chained together radially, in a single plane.</p> <h2 id="initial-design">Initial Design</h2> <div class="row mt-3 justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-md-6 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/cycloid/solidworks-asm-200.webp 200w,/assets/img/cycloid/solidworks-asm-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/cycloid/solidworks-asm-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/cycloid/solidworks-asm-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/cycloid/solidworks-asm.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="First version of cycloidal clock" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">First revision of the cycloidal clock</figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> <p>I was able to come to a design I was happy with by the deadline for the project, but the clock was rather large, had no power or drive system, and was not particularly manufacturable. But the mechanism itself was functional in CAD, and it served the purposes of the class project, which did not require me to actually build my design. Since that class focused on comparing 2 CAD softwares - CREO Parametric and Solidworks, I modeled my design and produced drawings in both, which are shown below. I find it interesting to compare the differences in visual style between the two softwares - CREO’s drawings(left) are much more striking.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-md-6 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/cycloid/Creo-Drawing-200.webp 200w,/assets/img/cycloid/Creo-Drawing-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/cycloid/Creo-Drawing-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/cycloid/Creo-Drawing-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/cycloid/Creo-Drawing.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Creo Drawing of clock mounting plate" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-md-6 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/cycloid/Solidworks-Drawing-200.webp 200w,/assets/img/cycloid/Solidworks-Drawing-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/cycloid/Solidworks-Drawing-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/cycloid/Solidworks-Drawing-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/cycloid/Solidworks-Drawing.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Solidworks Drawing of clock mounting plate" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <h2 id="fixing-it-up">Fixing it up</h2> <p>More recently, I decided to go back and redesign the clock into something both manufacturable and beautiful. The design I came up with would use stainless steel sheet for the gears, held onto the back plane with magnets and driven by a small stepper motor. I managed to shrink the design somewhat - making the design parametric allowed me to easily change the sizes and tooth counts of each stage, letting me iterate quickly through gear profiles and sizes. The CAD for this version was done using onshape, <a href="https://cad.onshape.com/documents/6c451e4294f56b11346f6eca/w/8283c5e1aac9d7144dc17c54/e/ba40aee599be0f51e1387e2e?renderMode=0&amp;uiState=658b97496f79aa00b39778c0">and is available online</a>. I’ve also added a quick clip of the animated CAD model below - personally I find the rotation <em>incrediby</em> satisfying.</p> <p>I have yet to fully test the design,and have some worries about the amount of friction it might have between stages. I’ve created a couple 3D printed models of single stages, but not gotten up the courage to actually order metal parts yet.</p> <div class="justify-content-sm-center"> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vTKVgvDKzgA?playlist=vTKVgvDKzgA&amp;loop=1" width="100%" max-width="90vw" height="600px"></iframe> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="school-project"/><category term="DIY"/><category term="CAD"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A custom designed clock using nested cycloidal drives.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Dual-Stage 3D Printing</title><link href="https://nwestie.github.io/article/2024/dual-stage/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dual-Stage 3D Printing"/><published>2024-09-29T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://nwestie.github.io/article/2024/dual-stage</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nwestie.github.io/article/2024/dual-stage/"><![CDATA[<hr/> <h2 id="an-overview">An Overview:</h2> <p>As a part of Widener University’s summer research program, I joined a project under Dr. William Nagel working to apply dual-stage actuators to 3D printing in an effort to increase print speeds. Printing faster is a core goal of the 3D printing field, allowing each printer to be more productive, but machines quickly run into bandwidth limitations as speed increases. As high speed, an actuator’s precision becomes worse, and the precision of larger actuators will be worse than small ones. For 3D printing, this means that it is difficult to increase speed without switching to lower-range actuators, which would sacrifice working area.</p> <p>Dual stage systems address this by pairing a large, long rang actuator (LRA) with a smaller one capable of high speed and precision - allowing them to have both range and precision. For the purposes of our 3D printer, the nozzle is mounted to a short-range actuator(SRA) and the bed to the long range actuator(LRA), as illustrated below. However, because each axis now has 2 actuators, controlling it is more complex than a traditional printer. For my research, I focused on designing such a controller.</p> <div class="row mt-3 justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-md-8 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/dual-stage/dsa-hardware-whitebg-200.webp 200w,/assets/img/dual-stage/dsa-hardware-whitebg-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/dual-stage/dsa-hardware-whitebg-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/dual-stage/dsa-hardware-whitebg-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/dual-stage/dsa-hardware-whitebg.png" width="100%" height="auto" title="Diagram of Dual stage printer actuators" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>In the final version of the control system(Non-causal controller), the path for each printer axis is generated by parsing standard 3D printing g-code, and then these target trajectories are split into targets for the LRA and SRA, using a low pass filter to separate the lower acceleration motions from the higher-acceleration parts. In previous versions(Reactive controller), the feedback controller received only a single target path for each axis, which it then used to generate commands for the two actuators, but filtering beforehand and separating the control loops improved performance (See <strong>implementation details</strong>). Below, you can see the final controller compared to this previous, single-loop reactive controller, as well as a reference of how the system would perform without the addition of the short range actuator.</p> <div class="row mt-3 justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-md-8 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/dual-stage/overlaid-cutout-200.webp 200w,/assets/img/dual-stage/overlaid-cutout-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/dual-stage/overlaid-cutout-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/dual-stage/overlaid-cutout-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/dual-stage/overlaid-cutout.png" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">Comparison of 3 actuators over 30x60mm rectangle</figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="row mt-3 justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-md-8 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/dual-stage/error-comparison-200.webp 200w,/assets/img/dual-stage/error-comparison-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/dual-stage/error-comparison-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/dual-stage/error-comparison-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/dual-stage/error-comparison.png" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">Error as speed increases.</figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> <p>If if instead error is held constant, we can compare the time needed to finish a sample print.

These simulations show that applying dual-stage control to 3D printing shows promise, and I continue to work on this controller and the printer hardware with the project team.

At a high level, a 3D model is sliced (using <a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/prusaslicer/">PrusaSlicer</a>), and the g-code this generates is parsed into uniform-time trajectories listing the position of each actuator every millisecond. The X and Y trajectories are then low-pass filtered using a python script to generate LRA and SRA targets for these axes. These target trajectories are used as input to a Simulink model of the dual stage hardware, which is implemented using transfer functions of the dual stage hardware.</p> <p>The final controller has two key advantages over earlier versions: it uses a non-causal filter on the target trajectories, and separates the control loops for the long and short range actuators. This can be seen generally in the diagram below - showing the control structure for a single dual stage axis. The definitions for each system block are described under <strong>System Models</strong>.</p> <div class="row mt-3 justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-md-8 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/dual-stage/system-diagram-whitebg-200.webp 200w,/assets/img/dual-stage/system-diagram-whitebg-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/dual-stage/system-diagram-whitebg-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/dual-stage/system-diagram-whitebg-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/dual-stage/system-diagram-whitebg.png" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>A standard low-pass filter removes the higher frequency components of a signal, which can be thought of as ‘smoothing’ it, but introduces some delay. This is the approach used by the reactive controller - where filtering takes place in the control loop. However, since the entire target path of the actuator is known, a <strong>non-causal</strong> filter can be used, meaning the filter accounts future target positions to calculate the current smoothed target, and removes the delaying effect. In practice, I used an iterative first order low pass filter of the form \(y[n]=(1-\alpha)*y[n-1]+\alpha*x[n]\), where \(y[n]\) is the output at time \(n\) and \(x[n]\) is the input.</p> <p>Running this first over filter over the target path forwards and then in reverse results in a second order filtered signal without the time delay introduced by causal filtering. When run over a time-reversed signal, the output depends on input values later in the trajectory, which is only possible because the input is known for all time. Removing the signal lag reduces the LRA error, allowing the system to be more accurate in its movement. In this controller, the SRA is assigned the difference between the original target and the low-pass filtered LRA target.</p> <div class="row mt-3 justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-md-8 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/dual-stage/causal-noncausal-200.webp 200w,/assets/img/dual-stage/causal-noncausal-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/dual-stage/causal-noncausal-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/dual-stage/causal-noncausal-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/dual-stage/causal-noncausal.png" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Switching to two parallel feedback controllers also contributes to improved system performance, also making it much less sensitive to changes in PID tunings, speeding development. In the reactive controller, slight changes in the tuning parameters could cause significant oscillations in the output, but with separate feedback loops each PID controller can be tuned for their specific actuator, improving performance. It made sense to implement these two changes simultaneously, since the non-causal filtering requires having separate inputs to the LRA and SRA controllers and therefore separate control loops, however this makes it difficult to determine how much of the performance improvements can be attributed to each of these changes.</p> <h3 id="system-models">System Models:</h3> <p>For those interested, these are the transfer functions modeling the behavior of our printer as well as the PID controller and filters used in the simulation. \(LRA(s)\) and \(SRA(s)\) model the response of each actuator to an input, and \(PID_j\) represents a standard PID controller in the form of a transfer function. \(C_L\) is a first order low-pass filter, used to filter the PID output in the reactive controller.</p> \[𝑃𝐼𝐷_𝑗(𝑠)=𝑘_{𝑝_𝑗}+\frac{𝑘_{𝑖_𝑗}}{𝑠}+𝑘_{𝑑_𝑗}𝑠\] \[𝐶_𝐿(𝑠)=\frac{\omega_𝑐}{𝑠+\omega_𝑐}\] \[𝐿𝑅𝐴(𝑠)=𝑘_𝐿\frac{\omega_𝐿^2}{𝑠^2+2\zeta_𝐿 \omega_𝐿 𝑠+\omega_𝐿^2}\] \[𝑆𝑅𝐴(𝑠)=𝑘_𝑠\frac{𝜔_𝑠^2}{𝑠^2+2\zeta_𝑠 \omega_𝑠 𝑠+\omega_𝑠^2}*\frac{𝑠+𝑧}{𝑠+𝑝}\] <p><strong>Where:</strong></p> \[\omega_c=18Hz\] <table> <thead> <tr> <th style="text-align: right">Variable:</th> <th>\(PID_C\)</th> <th>\(PID_R\)</th> <th>\(PID_L\)</th> <th>\(PID_S\)</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: right">\(k_p\)</td> <td>320</td> <td>4.2</td> <td>320</td> <td>175</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: right">\(k_i\)</td> <td>400</td> <td>770</td> <td>400</td> <td>700</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: right">\(k_d\)</td> <td>0.2</td> <td>0.28</td> <td>0.2</td> <td>0.455</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="project"/><category term="research"/><category term="control-systems"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A research project applying dual stage control to 3D printing.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Balance Bot</title><link href="https://nwestie.github.io/article/2024/travis/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Balance Bot"/><published>2024-01-03T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-01-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://nwestie.github.io/article/2024/travis</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nwestie.github.io/article/2024/travis/"><![CDATA[<hr/> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-md-4 align-self-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/travis/travis-closed-200.webp 200w,/assets/img/travis/travis-closed-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/travis/travis-closed-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/travis/travis-closed-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/travis/travis-closed.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Balancing robot, Travis" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-md-4 align-self-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/travis/travis-open-200.webp 200w,/assets/img/travis/travis-open-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/travis/travis-open-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/travis/travis-open-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/travis/travis-open.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Balancing robot, Travis" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>My senior year of high school, I requested an independent study in robotics, with my primary project being the design of a 2 wheeled balancing robot. I designed this robot (eventually dubbed Travis) from scratch, with the goal being to have it balance itself on two wheels and be controlled over bluetooth from my phone. This project ended up taking the entire year, and while it was balancing by the end of the year, it required constant attention and trimming to keep it in one place. After graduating, I’ve continued to iterate on the design, attempting to make it balance more robustly.</p> <p>I designed the chassis and electronics myself, using Autodesk Fusion 360 for the mechanical parts, and a tool called <a href="https://bancika.github.io/diy-layout-creator/">DIY-LC</a> to plan the electronics. In hindsight, there are much better ways to have planned the electronics, but this got the job done at the time and allowed me to plan how I would lay things out on the perf-board. The main controller is a teensy LC micro-controller, which I programmed using the Arduino framework, and paired with a bluetooth chip, an accelerometer/gyroscope, and a motor driver. The bot could sense it’s pitch angle using the accelerometer and wheel rotation from the encoders on the drive motors, and from this information a balancing controller could keep it upright.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-md-5 align-self-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/travis/BalBotTeensy-200.webp 200w,/assets/img/travis/BalBotTeensy-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/travis/BalBotTeensy-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/travis/BalBotTeensy-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/travis/BalBotTeensy.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="the electronics diagram for Travis" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-md-5 align-self-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/travis/cad-200.webp 200w,/assets/img/travis/cad-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/travis/cad-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/travis/cad-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/travis/cad.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="CAD design of 3D printed shell" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>The robot code is written in C++, using the Arduino libraries for the teensy, and uses a PID controller to balance the robot based on the bluetooth input and sensor readings.

The design worked nearly as intended when we printed our first prototype - shown below - although because of the somewhat generous tolerances we used when designing, the fingers opened a bit further then expected. To opperate the device, strings run through the loops on the palm-side of the hand to be pulled by an actuator in the wrist, and elastic returns the fingers to an open position.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-7 align-self-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/handcad/parts-200.webp 200w,/assets/img/handcad/parts-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/handcad/parts-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/handcad/parts-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/handcad/parts.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="3D printed components" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/handcad/finished-hand-200.webp 200w,/assets/img/handcad/finished-hand-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/handcad/finished-hand-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/handcad/finished-hand-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/handcad/finished-hand.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="assembled hand" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="school-project"/><category term="CAD"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A human-like 3D printable hand actuated by strings.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">TSA - HS</title><link href="https://nwestie.github.io/article/2022/tsa/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="TSA - HS"/><published>2022-05-10T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-05-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://nwestie.github.io/article/2022/tsa</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nwestie.github.io/article/2022/tsa/"><![CDATA[<hr/> <p>As a senior in high school, I competed in the PA TSA State CAD Engineering competition, and placed 2nd overall, qualifying for nationals.

As president I worked with our advisor to coordinate the clubs activites, competitions, and fundraisers, as well as helping guide some of the newer members as they completed their competition projects.</p> <p>I also competed in the Flight Endurance competition, where participants build lightweight rubber band powered airplanes designed to stay airborne as long as possible while adhering to the weight and size constraints. The plane I built weighted 9 grams, and could fly for roughly 90 seconds before running out of power. It’s difficult to convey just how light these aircraft look and feel, and they are quite difficult to build well. Because there is no control input to the planes, they must be tuned to climb gradually at the beginning - when the rubber band provides the most power - but not so much that they strike the roof. The plane must also be tuned to circle slowely to avoid hitting the walls of the room, which is challenging as the turn radius will vary depending not just on the tuning of the plane, but also the amount of power it’s producing and any air currents it runs through.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-4 align-self-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/tsa/plane2022-200.webp 200w,/assets/img/tsa/plane2022-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/tsa/plane2022-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/tsa/plane2022-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/tsa/plane2022.png" class="img-fluid img-responsive rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="drawings of the plane" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm-4 align-self-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/tsa/plane-portrait-200.webp 200w,/assets/img/tsa/plane-portrait-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/tsa/plane-portrait-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/tsa/plane-portrait-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/tsa/plane-portrait.jpg" class="img-fluid img-responsive rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="portrait with plane" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="school-project"/><category term="CAD"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Competed in the PA TSA CAD and flight events.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Rumors Set</title><link href="https://nwestie.github.io/article/2022/rumors/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Rumors Set"/><published>2022-04-10T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-04-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://nwestie.github.io/article/2022/rumors</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nwestie.github.io/article/2022/rumors/"><![CDATA[<hr/> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/rumors/stgL-empty-200.webp 200w,/assets/img/rumors/stgL-empty-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/rumors/stgL-empty-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/rumors/stgL-empty-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/rumors/stgL-empty.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Close up view of completed set" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>My senior year of high school, I had the opportunity to design and build a set for York Suburban Trojan Theatre’s production of <i>Our Town</i> by Neil Simon.

Some people baked bread, I decided to build a robot. The NXT platform was what I had available at the time, and I built a cartesian gantry capable with a mount for a whiteboard pen.</p> <p>The heart of the project was the code - I used <a href="https://bricxcc.sourceforge.net/nbc/">NXC</a>, a C based language and compiler built for the NXT, and wrote custom software to read G-code from a file and control the motion of the plotter. I used Fusion 360 to generate G-code, and the printer can handle nearly all of the commands commonly used by 3D printers.</p> <h2 id="pc-driver-program">PC Driver Program</h2> <p>In addition to the robot, I built a command line program to control the robot remotely, connecting over USB or bluetooth to stream G-Code files to the robot. This sped up testing by removing the need to upload G-code to the robot, and allowed for larger g-code files to be used. The NXT is fairly old hardware, and while just plaintext, G-code files can become rather large when drawing complex curves. I also wrote the driver program in C++, and made use of the <a href="https://github.com/corywalker/nxt-plus-plus">NXT++</a> library to handle all communications with the NXT.</p> <hr/> <p>The code for the project is on Github:</p> <div class="repositories d-flex flex-wrap flex-md-row flex-column justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="repo p-2 text-center"> <a href="https://github.com/nWestie/nxt-drawbot"> <img class="repo-img-light w-100" alt="nWestie/nxt-drawbot" src="https://github-readme-stats-fast.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=nWestie&amp;repo=nxt-drawbot&amp;theme=default&amp;show_owner=false&amp;description_lines_count=2"/> <img class="repo-img-dark w-100" alt="nWestie/nxt-drawbot" src="https://github-readme-stats-fast.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=nWestie&amp;repo=nxt-drawbot&amp;theme=dark&amp;show_owner=false&amp;description_lines_count=2"/> </a> </div> </div> <p><br/> And some additional example drawings are below: <br/></p> <h2 id="trombone-drawing">Trombone Drawing</h2> <div class="justify-content-sm-center"> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h-ReSmWMP4c" width="100%" max-width="90vw" height="450px"></iframe> </div> <p><br/></p> <h2 id="house-drawing">House Drawing</h2> <div class="justify-content-sm-center"> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kh3upxtFZQ4" width="100%" max-width="90vw" height="450px"></iframe> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="lego"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A custom pen plotter built with LEGO Mindstorms NXT.]]></summary></entry></feed>
