My senior year of high school, I had the opportunity to design and build a set for York Suburban Trojan Theatre's production of <i>Our Town</i> by Neil Simon. With input student leadership and faculty directors, I designed the set from the description in the script and a number of reference photos we found. 

After settling on the style and layout, I made a detailed 2D layout of the set in Fusion 360. From there, I expanded the model into 3D to plan the actual construction of the set. From this structural model, I made drawings to use when constructing the set.

    <div class="col-md-8 align-self-center">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/rumors/drawp1.png" title="Completed 3D construction model of the set" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-md mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/rumors/drawp2.png" title="2D overview drawing" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-md mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/rumors/drawp5.png" title="Stair stringer drawing" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-md mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/rumors/drawp7.png" title="Balcony drawing with banister spacings" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
With a team of 6 other students, I led the construction of the set in the weeks leading up to the show. When finished, the set was quite grand, and fit the vision of the directors and actors.
