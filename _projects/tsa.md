As a senior in high school, I competed in the PA TSA State CAD Engineering competition, and placed 2nd overall, qualifying for nationals. In this competition, we were provided 3 part drawings, and asked to model the parts shown in 3D before redrawing them. For this competition, I used Autodesk Fusion 360.

The [Technology Student Association](tsaweb.org) is a national organization that hosts STEM competitions at the national, state, and regional levels. School chapters of middle and high school students compete in a wide range of individual and team events, ranging from programming to model bridge construction to fashion design. In the 2021-22 school year, I was the president of the York Suburban High School chapter of the TSA.

I also competed in the Flight Endurance competition, where participants build lightweight rubber band powered airplanes designed to stay airborne as long as possible while adhering to the weight and size constraints. The plane I built weighted 9 grams, and could fly for roughly 90 seconds before running out of power.
