Our introductory engineering CAD course at Grove City teaches PTC Creo Parametric, and as a final project, students are asked to work with a group to design and manufacture a small-scale device of their choosing. Our group choose to make a roughly 1:1 scale bio-mimetic hand, actuated by strings and elastic bands. Each group member designed a number of components, but I was responsible for the intermediate finger joint, an angled version for the thumb, and creating the assembly of all components.

I also was responsible for assembling the components of our prototype, which was fully 3D printed except for commonly available cotton cord and elastic band.
