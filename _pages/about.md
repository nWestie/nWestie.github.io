I've been interested in machines, computers, and most things mechanical for as long as I can remember, it's just how I grew up (the fact that my father is an engineer might have something to do with that). Currently, I'm studying Mechanical Engineering at Grove City College, and minoring in Robotics and Computer Science. Before college, I was already persuing engineering and robotics as a hobby, and throughout high school, I taught myself basic mechanical design, electronics, and programming, starting with the basics using Lego Mindstorms, and gradually becoming confident enough to move on to the Arduino Framework, custom designed electronics, and 3D Printing.   

I still am pushing myself to learn new skills in these areas, and recently have learning the CAD softwares Creo Parametric and Solidworks in addition to Fusion 360 for my coursework, and continuing work on my self-balancing robot. 

After college, I'd like to persue a careeer in robotics or energy systems, as these fields are currently evolving quickly, and lie at the intesection of Mechanical, Electrical, Computer, and Software engineering, which is an overlap I find particularly facinating.

I also love applying my passion for engineering to the arts, and designed and built sets throughout high school. At Grove City, I work with the theatrical production team, operating lighting, sound, and video for a variety of musical, theatrical, and dance productions.
