I am a Robotics Engineering student who has a passion for control systems and automation. 
Currently, I am persuing my bachelors degree in Robotics Engineering at Widener University. 
Aside from my schoolwork, I am the president of Widener Robotics Club, where I am leading a team in designing an antweight class combat robot, as well as Widener's chapter of the vertical Flight Society.
