I am a Robotics Engineering student who has a passion for control systems and automation. 
Currently, I am persuing my bachelors degree in Robotics Engineering at Widener University. 
Aside from my schoolwork, I am the president of Widener Robotics Club, where I am leading a team in designing an antweight class combat robot, as well as Widener's chapter of the vertical Flight Society.


I also have a range of robotics and software projects outside of school: Some of my favorites are [Travis]({% link _projects/travis.md %}), a balancing robot I started work on in high school and am working to, and a [Cycloidal Gear Clock]({% link _projects/cycloids.md %}) I am currently prototyping.

As I continue to persue a career as a Robotics Engineer, I plan to continue learning both in the classroom outside of it, and this website serves to showcase some of the work I have done and am most proud of (as well as becoming something of a project in itself). 
A sampling of my personal projects, as well as some from my schoolwork, can be found on the [projects]({%link _pages/projects.md%}) page, and a copy of my resume is shown on the [resume]({%link _pages/resume.md%}) page. 
Code for many of these projects and a few others are hosred on my [github](https://github.com/nWestie).
